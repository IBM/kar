### Example Structure

Each child directory contains an example KAR application.

Each example contains a `deploy` directory that contains
artifacts for deploying the application. Multiple deployment modes may
be supported via a combination of scripts, yaml files, and Helm
charts. 

### Examples in a Nutshell

TODO: Summarize available examples and link to detailed readme for
each one.
